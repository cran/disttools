## Overview
Working with 'dist' objects in R can be challenging. What makes it challenging is that retrieving the distance between any two points requires specifying a 1 dimensional index. This is non-intuitive and requires the user to write additional code, which slows development and analysis. To avoid this problem, the function *as.matrix* has typically been used to convert a 'dist' object into a matrix. Once converted, distances can be accessed in the same way any element of a matrix is accessed, namely using two indices. Unfortunately, *as.matrix* conversion more than doubles memory usage. For small 'dist' objects this may not be a problem. However, for large 'dist' objects this can be quite problematic. The function *get_dists* in *disttools* solves this problem by facilitating rapid retrieval of the distance between any pair of points stored in a 'dist' object.


## Installation
*disttools* can be installed from CRAN or GitHub by executing either of the following:
```r
# Install from CRAN.
install.packages("disttools")
```


```r
# Install from GitHub.
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mamc-dci/disttools")
```


## Usage
The package can be loaded by executing:
```r
# Load the package.
library(disttools)
```


The help file for the function *get_dists* can be accessed by executing:
```r
?get_dists
```


If installed, the package vignette, complete with examples, can be viewed by executing:
```r
browseVignettes("disttools")
```


Alternatively, the vignette is available on the package's CRAN page: [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=disttools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=disttools)
